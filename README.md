# Vector Addition with CUDA

This repository contains a simple CUDA program that performs vector addition. The program reads two vectors from binary files, adds them element-wise using a CUDA kernel, and outputs the result.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need the following:

- CUDA Toolkit installed (version 10.2 or higher recommended)
- A CUDA-capable GPU
- GCC or another compatible compiler for compiling the host code

## File Structure

- `main.cu`: The main program file that sets up and executes the CUDA kernel.
- `kernel.cu`: Contains the CUDA kernel for vector addition.
- `kernel.h`: Header file for the CUDA kernel.
- `file.h`: Header file for file I/O functions.
- `Makefile`: Makefile for compiling the program.
- `input1.dat`: Sample binary input file for the first vector (needs to be provided).
- `input2.dat`: Sample binary input file for the second vector (needs to be provided).
- `output.dat`: Output binary file containing the result vector.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program:**
   
   Use the provided Makefile to compile the program:
   
   ```sh
   make
   ```

2. **Prepare Input Files:**

   Ensure you have two binary input files (`input1.dat` and `input2.dat`). The files should be formatted as follows:
   - The first 4 bytes (unsigned int) indicate the number of elements in the vector.
   - The subsequent bytes represent the vector elements (floats).

3. **Run the Program:**

   Execute the compiled program with the input files:
   
   ```sh
   ./vecAdd input1.dat input2.dat
   ```

4. **Check the Output:**

   The program will print the first 10 values of the resulting vector to the console and write the entire result to `output.dat`.

## Example

Here is an example of how to create an input file in Python:

```python
import struct

# Example data
vector_size = 1024
data = [float(i) for i in range(vector_size)]

# Write to binary file
with open('input1.dat', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(struct.pack('I', vector_size))  # Write the size
    for value in data:
        f.write(struct.pack('f', value))  # Write the values

# Repeat for input2.dat with different or same data
```

## Notes

- Make sure your input files are correctly formatted as binary files.
- Ensure your environment has access to a CUDA-capable GPU.
- You can modify the `Makefile` to match your system's CUDA installation path if needed.
